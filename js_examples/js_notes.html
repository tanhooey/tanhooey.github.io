        <h2>VI. JavaScript </h2>
        <h3>Basic Overview</h3>
        <p>Javascript is a <i>light-weight, interpreted</i> programming
            language. The functionality of JavaScript can be divided into two
            classes: client-side and APIs. </p>
        <p><b>Client-side functionalities</b> include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Storing information into variables</li>
            <li>Performing operations on strings and other content on page</li>
            <li>Running code in response to certain events on a page (i.e. a
                click)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Application Programming Interfaces, or <b>APIs</b>, are ready made
            sets of code that allow programmers to implement certain
            functionalities that would be
            hard/impossible to build by scratch. APIs fall into two categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Browser APIs </b>are built into the browser you're using.
                They are able to expose data regarding the surrounding computer
                environment and perform other complex tasks. An important
                browser API is the <b>DOM (Document Object Model) API</b>, which
                allows for dynamic changing of HTML and CSS on the webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Third-party APIs</b> are not built into the browser by
                default. An example is the <b>Twitter API</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Client-side vs Server-side Code, Dynamic vs Static</h3>
        <p><i>Client-side code</i> is code that is run on the user's machine.
        </p>
        <p><i>Server-side code</i> is code that is run on the server. The
            results of the code are downloaded and displayed in the browser.
        </p>
        <p><i>Dynamic code</i> is code that can update a webpage based on
            different circumstances. This can happen both on the server and
            client side.</p>
        <p><i>Static code</i> is code that does not change content of a webpage
            at all.</p>
        <h3>Applying JS to Your Site</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is integrated into HTML using the &lt;script&gt; element
            (remember it is <i>not</i> a void element; a closing tag is needed).
            There are multiple ways this can be used: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Internal JavaScript</b>: The JavaScript code is found right
                in our HTML. It is inserted as the content of the &lt;script&gt;
                element in the head of the document.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>External JavaScript</b>: The JavaScript code is imported from
                an external .js file. The path to the file is specified via the
                <b>src</b> tag within the &lt;script&gt; element.
                The content of the script element is empty.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>HTML/CSS First, JS Last</h3>
        <p>Many issues can arise if you try to load JS simultaneously/before the
            HTML is completely loaded onto the page. </p>
        <h3>Variables and Constants</h3>
        <p>Variables are names for values. You create a variable with the
            keyword <strong>let</strong>, followed by the name of your variable.</p>
        <p> Constants are also used to name values, but they can't be changed
            once they've been set. You create a constant with the keyword
            <strong>const</strong>. </p>
        <h3> Mini JS Tutorials and Projects </h3>
        <p>Here is a list of JS projects I've worked on: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="number-guessing-game-start.html">Number
                    Guessing Game</a></li>
